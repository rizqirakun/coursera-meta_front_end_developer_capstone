## Grade assessment

The primary purpose of the assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course. The assessment is designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned. Most importantly, the assessment helps you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before completing the course.

You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course to write code to create a form that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant. Your table bookings form will all be assessed in the peer review submission, and you will assess some of your peers' projects too.
